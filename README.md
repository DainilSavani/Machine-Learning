# Machine-Learning

#Mini project is a project about Email spam detection techniques.

I took the database from the Kaggle site. Then after perfroming pre-processing on a data I used three different techniques to predict whether a E-mail is spammed one or not.
In first technique I used logistic regression method as we have to devide all the E-mails into two class Spam or not-spam.
Then I applied single layer and multilayer perceptron methods to compare the accuracy of all the methods.
And it's clear that multilayer perceptron has the most accurate result.
